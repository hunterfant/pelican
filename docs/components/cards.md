## Best Practices

- When a Card occurs **outside** a [Content Container](/components/content_container/), it has a white background.
- When a Card occurs **inside** a [Content Container](/components/content_container/) it has a gray background.
- Titles or headers in Cards may need an appropriate [Heading Level](/accessibility/headings/).
- Cards are flexible enough to accommodate most content types.
- A cardâ€™s width is determined by its parent element. This might be a `<div>` with a Bootstrap column class. [Read Layout Grid](/components/layout-grid/) for more information.
- Rows and columns can be placed inside a card body.
- Cards can be themed using theming classes. Read more in [Agency Themes](/foundation/agency-theming/).
